The Room Standard 1.0.0
==============================

Summary
-------

The Room Standard establishes a simple convention for talking about room for cream. When a consumer orders a hot beverage from a provider and there is a verbal exchange about leaving room in the container for a condiment such as cream or milk:

1. Room is specified as a number of units from the top or from the lid.
1. A unit of room is a vertical measurement about equal to the width of a standard #2 pencil.
1. From the lid means from the lowest part of the lid.

Introduction
------------	

There is a problem that sometimes occurs when ordering coffee or tea. If you like to add cream or milk to your beverage you need room for it. The amount of room desired varies from one person to the next for a variety of reasons, and there is no commonly understood way to specify how much room you want.

This often creates the need for awkward and confused conversations as the consumer and provider attempt to converge on a common understanding of the amount of room desired. It also leads to unfortunate outcomes like a cup overflowing all over the condiment counter while other customers are waiting, or garbage bags containing large volumes of liquid that have been poured into the garbage.

As a solution to this problem, I propose a simple system of approximate measurement and an accompanying nomenclature that, once adopted, make it possible to quickly and effortlessly arrive at unambiguous agreement about the amount of room desired.

I call this system the Room Standard.

The Room Specification
------------------------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

1. A consumer is anyone communicating their beverage preferences to another person where the other person functions as a provider.
1. A provider is anyone preparing a beverage according to preferences communicated to them by a consumer.
1. An amount of room MUST be expressed as a number of units in the form "N from the top" OR "N from the lid", where:
1. N is a non-negative number. The use of whole numbers is RECOMMENDED when specifying units of room. The use of fractional numbers is OPTIONAL. A provider MAY decline to support the use of fractional numbers.
1. A unit of room is a vertical linear measurement about equal to the thickness of a standard #2 pencil (about 1/4 inch or about 7 millimeters). (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil#By_size) A unit of room MUST NOT be used to express or provision a measurement of area or volume.
1. The top is the point on the container at which the container, when placed in a stable position on a flat stable surface, would begin to overflow upon the introduction of additional contents.
1. When room is specified in the form "N from the top", room MUST be provisioned in the number of units specified, measured vertically from the top.
1. The lid is the matching accessory fitting in or over and covering the top, which may take up some of the space below the top.
1. When room is specifed in the form "N from the lid", room MUST be provisioned in the number of units specified, measured vertically from the lower extremity of the space occupied by the lid.
